# Gait Recognition using Depth Vision in a Non-static background - [CMP 490/491] Senior-Design
Research, design and implementation of 4 Gait Recognition algorithms using depth vision, image processing and machine learning to identify individuals based on their gait. Additionally, a system with a GUI was created for ease of use. Algorithms created, yielded up to 97% precision. Tools: Python (Spyder), Intel RealSense D435
